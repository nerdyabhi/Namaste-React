### Optimising our code.

#### Single responsibility principle:
Suppose if you have a function or any entitiy , it should have single responsibility.
 

### Higher Order Components
A Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new component with enhanced behavior or additional props. It allows code reuse and logic sharing between components.
 
#### Key Points
1. HOCs do not modify the original component; instead, they create a wrapper component around it.

2. Theyâ€™re primarily used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, theming, or handling subscriptions.
